      <h1>Shamestone</h1>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 19px;"> -noune. /'ÊƒÃ¦mËŒstoÊŠn/: A mythical object with the alleged ability to take away and release the shame of those who are in its presence. The origins and existence of this object are uncertain.</p>

<hr>
<p>Many of us have felt ashamed and betrayed by our own actions, or the actions of others. We have felt like we don't belong, and we have struggled to let go of our feelings of shame and unfaithfulness. But the Shamestone can help us release these harmful emotions and find peace and healing. With the Shamestone by our side, we can learn to let go of our shame and find our way to a better place, where we can find happiness and fulfillment.</p>

<p>Now that you have found the Shamestone, you are invited to take it with you and use it to release your own shame and negativity. You can keep it with you as a reminder to let go of these harmful emotions, or use it as a talisman to protect you from negative energy, even give it to a friend in need.
</p>

<p>We also encourage you to move the stone to a different place to keep the stone rolling, preferably in a public location where others can find and use it. You could leave it on a park bench, on a hiking trail, or even in a bookstore.  Just remember to be respectful and considerate of others when deciding where to place the stone.</p> 

<p>The purpose of this stone is to keep on rolling arround the streets of Norway or beyond. The stone has a GPS, allowing those who are protecting it to keep track of its location.</p>

<p>We hope you find comfort and peace through this stone, and that it brings you and others healing and joy.</p>
